## Development server 

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Make sure you run the `npm start` command from the project's \soccer-project directory. 
E.g. C:\Users\Owner\Documents\GitHub\soccer-project> npm start .
Must be connected to the UW-Whitewater network while running the application as the dabatase is located on the washington.uww.edu server. Connecting through a vpn such as Cisco Anyconnect will accomplish this.  

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
